Replicating the powerful "Rewrite" feature offered by Apple's ecosystem on other platforms may seem like a daunting task, but with the right combination of open-source tools and libraries, we can create a comprehensive solution that rivals the original. By leveraging the capabilities of Ollama, a state-of-the-art language model, along with the keyboard automation provided by `pynput` and the clipboard management of `pyperclip`, we can build a cross-platform text rewriting tool that seamlessly integrates with various applications and workflows.
